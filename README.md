# Hospital Triage Simulation – CS313E Term Project

Author: Isabella Castillo  
Course: CS313E – Elements of Data Analytics  

## Project Description
This project simulates hospital triage and patient flow to analyze factors that contribute to long wait times in emergency departments. Using data structures and algorithms from class, the simulation models patient arrivals, prioritization, and treatment.

## Data Structures Used
- Lists
- Queues
- Dictionaries
- Min-Heap

## Algorithms Used
- Scheduling / Priority-based processing
- Simulation modeling

## Files
- hospital_triage.ipynb – main simulation notebook
- CS313E-Term-Project.pdf – project proposal/instructions

## How to Run
1. Download the notebook
2. Open in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells from top to bottom

## Expected Outcome
The simulation outputs estimated wait times and shows how triage level, staffing, and arrival rates impact flow.
